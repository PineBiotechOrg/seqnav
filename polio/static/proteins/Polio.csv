P1,P1,PROTEIN,746,3385,2,881,0,"VP1,VP2,VP3,VP4",Forms an icosahedral capsid of pseudo T=3 symmetry with capsid proteins VP2 and VP3. The capsid is 300 Angstroms in diameter, composed of 60 copies of each capsid protein and enclosing the viral positive strand RNA genome.
Capsid Protein VP0,VP0,PROTEIN,746,1765,,,1,,"Protein 2B: Plays an essential role in the virus replication cycle by acting as a viroporin. Creates a pore in the host reticulum endoplasmic and as a consequence releases Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of infected cell. In turn, high levels of cyctoplasmic calcium may trigger membrane trafficking and transport of viral ER-associated proteins to viroplasms, sites of viral genome replication."
Capsid Protein VP3,VP3,PROTEIN,1766,2479,342,579,1,VP1-VP2CoatProtein,
Capsid Protein VP1,VP1,PROTEIN,2480,3385,580,881,1,VP1-VP2CoatProtein,"Capsid protein VP3: Forms an icosahedral capsid of pseudo T=3 symmetry with capsid proteins VP2 and VP3. The capsid is 300 Angstroms in diameter, composed of 60 copies of each capsid protein and enclosing the viral positive strand RNA genome."
Capsid Protein VP4,VP4,PROTEIN,746,949,2,69,2,VP1-VP2CoatProtein,"Protein 2A: Cysteine protease that cleaves viral polyprotein and specific host proteins. It is responsible for the cleavage between the P1 and P2 regions, first cleavage occurring in the polyprotein. Cleaves also the host translation initiation factor EIF4G1, in order to shut down the capped cellular mRNA translation. Inhibits the host nucleus-cytoplasm protein and RNA trafficking by cleaving host members of the nuclear pores including NUP98, NUP62 and NUP153."
Capsid Protein VP2,VP2,PROTEIN,950,1765,70,341,2,VP1-VP2CoatProtein,"Capsid protein VP4: Lies on the inner surface of the capsid shell. After binding to the host receptor, the capsid undergoes conformational changes. Capsid protein VP4 is released, Capsid protein VP1 N-terminus is externalized, and together, they shape a pore in the host membrane through which the viral genome is translocated into the host cell cytoplasm. After genome has been released, the channel shrinks (By similarity)."
P2,P2,PROTEIN,3386,5110,882,1456,0,,"Protein 2C: Induces and associates with structural rearrangements of intracellular membranes. Triggers host autophagy by interacting with host BECN1 and thereby promotes viral replication. Participates in viral replication and interacts with host DHX9. Displays RNA-binding, nucleotide binding and NTPase activities. May play a role in virion morphogenesis and viral RNA encapsidation by interacting with the capsid protein VP3."

Protein 2BC,2BC,PROTEIN,3833,5110,1031,1456,1,,"Protein 3AB: Localizes the viral replication complex to the surface of membranous vesicles. Together with protein 3CD binds the Cis-Active RNA Element (CRE) which is involved in RNA synthesis initiation. Acts as a cofactor to stimulate the activity of 3D polymerase, maybe through a nucleid acid chaperone activity."
Protein 2B,2B,PROTEIN,3833,4123,1031,1127,2,2B,"Protein 3A: Localizes the viral replication complex to the surface of membranous vesicles. It inhibits host cell endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi apparatus transport and causes the dissassembly of the Golgi complex, possibly through GBF1 interaction. This would result in depletion of MHC, trail receptors and IFN receptors at the host cell surface."
Protein 2C,2C,PROTEIN,4124,5110,1128,1456,2,2C,"Viral protein genome-linked: acts as a primer for viral RNA replication and remains covalently bound to viral genomic RNA. VPg is uridylylated prior to priming replication into VPg-pUpU. The oriI viral genomic sequence may act as a template for this. The VPg-pUpU is then used as primer on the genomic RNA poly(A) by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to replicate the viral genome. VPg may be removed in the cytoplasm by an unknown enzyme termed "unlinkase". VPg is not cleaved off virion genomes because replicated genomic RNA are encapsidated at the site of replication."
P3,P3,PROTEIN,5111,7369,1457,2209,0,,"Protein 3CD: Is involved in the viral replication complex and viral polypeptide maturation. It exhibits protease activity with a specificity and catalytic efficiency that is different from protease 3C. Protein 3CD lacks polymerase activity. The 3C domain in the context of protein 3CD may have an RNA binding activity."
Protein 3AB,3AB,PROTEIN,5111,5437,1457,1565,1,,"RNA-directed RNA polymerase: Replicates the viral genomic RNA on the surface of intracellular membranes. May form linear arrays of subunits that propagate along a strong head-to-tail interaction called interface-I. Covalently attaches UMP to a tyrosine of VPg, which is used to prime RNA synthesis. The positive stranded RNA genome is first replicated at virus induced membranous vesicles, creating a dsRNA genomic replication form. This dsRNA is then used as template to synthesize positive stranded RNA genomes. ss+RNA genomes are either translated, replicated or encapsidated."
